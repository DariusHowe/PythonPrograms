#Question
#You Are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street from east to west (rises in the east sets in the west)
#The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street

def property_val(buildings):
    #Counter for number of buildings that should see the sun set
    total=0
    finalView=[]
#Iterate through list right to left(backwards)
    westView=buildings[::-1]
    num=len(westView)
        while num>0:
            if
        return total
    print finalView
